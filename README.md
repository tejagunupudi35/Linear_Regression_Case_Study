# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. A detailed analysis was performed using a dataset provided by BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the US, to understand the significant factors affecting bike demand, especially in the context of the ongoing Corona pandemic.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various factors such as weather conditions, temperature, season, and year, which may influence the demand for shared bikes.

## Files in the Repository
- `Bike_sharing_case_study_Teja.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, model building, and validation.
- `day.csv`: Dataset file used for the analysis.
- `Readme.txt`: Data dictionary and additional details about the dataset.
- `residuals_vs_predicted.png`: Visualization of residuals vs. predicted values.
- `qq_plot_residuals.png`: Q-Q plot of residuals to check normality.
- Other visualization images as required.

## Analysis
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, checking the assumptions of linear regression, model building, and model validation. The key steps of the analysis are:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Building
4. Model Validation
5. Interpretation of the Results

## Usage
To replicate the analysis, follow the Jupyter notebook in a step-by-step manner. Additional scripts for visualizations and model diagnostics are also provided.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas library
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library
- Seaborn library
- Statsmodels library
- Scikit-learn library
